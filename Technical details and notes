1. Convert longitude and latitude of two cities into distance in miles: 

Use longitudes and lattitudes from the CSV zip code file and do the following: 
Improved approximate distance in miles:

    sqrt(x * x + y * y)
where x = 69.1 * (lat2 - lat1)
and y = 69.1 * (lon2 - lon1) * cos(lat1/57.3)

2. Another possible way to recommend zip code instead of direct filtering:
can perform a k-means clustering on criteria chosen by user, and recommend the cluster where the input data belong to
